Introduction
In this module we have to create a monogram from our intials. This journal is to document the research I have done to produce my final monogram. 

Firstly I looked at the history of monograms. Traditionally a monogram is a combination of intials used to form one symbol. They have been used in religions, royalty and coins.

One of the earliest monograms used as a signature was of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Dürer).

This week we are adding wordmarks to our monograms. I have been looking at different typefaces that would work well with my monogram. I's really like to add my signature to make it look like an artist signing off a painting.
