Week 1

Introduction
In this module we have to create a monogram from our intials. This journal is to document the research I have done to produce my final monogram. 

Firstly I looked at the history of monograms. Traditionally a monogram is a combination of intials used to form one symbol. They have been used in religions, royalty and coins.

One of the earliest monograms used as a signature was of [Albrecht D端rer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D端rer).
