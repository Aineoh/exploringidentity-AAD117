Week 1
-------

In this module we have to create a monogram from our initials. This journal is to document the research I have done to produce my final monogram. 

Firstly I looked at the history of monograms. Traditionally a monogram is a combination of initials used to form one symbol. They have been used in religions, royalty and coins. It started as a way to identify these things and now it has developed into a powerful branding tool. The two 'c's' in Chanel's branding was orginally a monogram but is now an international symbol.

I started out doing some research into different types of monograms. I looked at how I could use the letters of my initials and how the letters can be formed in different ways. This was an interesting area of work for me because I never looked at how letters can have irregular shapes, yet still work and be easy to read.

This week we picked our favourite design from our sketches and put them up for the class to see. I had alot of different sketches done so it was hard to pick my favourite.

After the class saw my monogram they had come up with some suggestions. One of the main ones was that the monogram didn't reflect me and my style of work. I agree with this as it looked very formal and dated.

This week we are adding wordmarks to our monograms. I have been looking at different typefaces that would work well with my monogram. I wanted to add my signature to make it look like an artist signing off a painting.
